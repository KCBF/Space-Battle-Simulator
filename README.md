# Space-Battle-Simulator
This space battle simulator was created using Unity DOTS C#.  
It was created as part of my Games and AI module course work, BSc Games Technology, Coventry University, Year 3, semester 2 2021.

Space ships fly around using an implementation of boids which causes ships on the same team to flock together. 
They exhibit shooting and chasing behaviour towards enemies and avoid obstacles. The user can possess ships and join the battle.
